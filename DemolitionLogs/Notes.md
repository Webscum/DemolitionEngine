* Partitioning code in functions for reuse should be standard practice and will result in more clear documentation and easier optimization instead of sloppy shit

* Making the engine text input based, you can manipulate items in the space with a SQL-like query language.

* Object has a rendering function using function pointers so it can be reused

- Making the query language myself is not viable at all in this project so maybe i should leave this project to make my own or then find a way or something so i can make this engine text based. This idea is fucking insane anyways so gonna go find some way to do this. Also had an idea for a side project called MrFreemanner, a program witch takes a face texture and puts it on a model of Gordon Freeman.

- Decided that queries are stupid and make the project more complex than it needs to be, although it was a cool concept the reality of it was that it would probably be a waste. The idea now is that we just make it so you don't need to move your hands from the keyboard to control the program, so select would be Ctrl+s and add to selection would be Ctrl+Shift+s so on and so forth, There is some roughness that needs to be smoothed but for example you could choose the type of attribute you are adding with keys and/or typing it out and pressing tab and other usual keyboard schemes. Overall the idea is there and it is quite good now, much simpler to execute and keeps the project simpler from a usage standpoint.
